Java Spring Boot Tutorial

This project was a follow-along to a Youtube Tutorial which built an application using SpringBoot in IntelliJ.
This application builds a Student database which consists of the Id, Name, Email Address, DOB, and Age.
In this project, SpringBoot was the API used to connect the server, database (JPADerby), and display to the user.
Overall, this project was fun and great practice. I plan to do many more as I enjoy doing these kinds of projects!
